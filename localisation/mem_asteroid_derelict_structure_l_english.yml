 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure_category_desc:0 "During the survey, [Root.GetLeaderName]'s team has detected a structure on the surface of the asteroid."

 # Failure
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.1.name:0 "Dangerous Conditions"
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.1.desc:0 "Whatever the structure once was, it has been lost to the ravages of time. Our probes have been unable to find a safe path to the structure, making salvage an impractical effort. [Root.GetLeaderName] has called off the expedition."
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.1.a:0 "Too bad.

 # Salvage
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.2.name:0 "Empty"
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.2.desc:0 "It appears whomever built the structure abandoned it long ago, leaving nothing behind to tell us of its intended purpose. While disappointing, at least the materials that make up the structure can be salvaged for use elsewhere."
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.2.a:0 "Unfortunate."

 # Power source
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.3.name:0 "Unknown Power Source"
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.3.desc:0 "Examination of the base has yeilded an unusual power source. It appears to be reliant on a miniature singularity held stable by unknown technology, and our researchers are understandably wary of attempting to interfere with such a source for study. However, it appears that the rest of the technology is well within our understanding, and the structure can be adapted to suit our needs."
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.3.a:0 "Make it happen."

 # Interesting composition
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.4.name:0 "A Space Oddity"
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.4.desc:0 "Our researchers are still unsure of the nature of the facility. However, the design of the structure itself is fascinating, and has been described as impossible as well as nauseating. Whoever inhabited the facility completely ignored most traditional thoughts of design, and it has led to some theories regarding the current state of our own structural engineering efforts. Placing a research facility in orbit could help to further understanding of the technology involved."
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.4.a:0 "Interesting."

 # Small warp loop
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.5.name:0 "Pendulum" 
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.5.desc:0 "It appears the base was designed for research. \n\nNear the asteroid is what appears to be a stable formation of disturbed subspace, which it appears several large asteroids were caught. The loop causes them to swing back and forth over the course of nearly an hour.\n\n While it does appear that the event is in decay, it is predicted that the effect of the loop will last at least 2.6 billion years, allowing us ample time to study its effects in full. Placing a reseach base of our own would help to facilitate further understanding of the phenomena."
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.5.a:0 "Fascinating."

 # Strange warp technology
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.6.name:0 "Mistakes"
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.6.desc:0 "Whoever designed this base did so with the purpose of researching an unknown propulsive technology for faster than light travel. Given the size of the crater which has destroyed nearly half of the base and left the rest exposed to vaccuum, it appears as if they were unsuccessful in their attempts. There are several prototypes within the facility which could be tested more carefully by our own researchers to determine exactly how, as well as if, they work. The rebuilding of the base would help to proceed with these experiments."
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.6.a:0 "Make it so."

 # Interesting biology
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.7.name:0 "Lost Laboratory "
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.7.desc:0 "Much of the original base has been lost to time. We have found several interesting leads. In a part of the structure open to space, we have found a large repository of biological samples, some of which have intense regenerative properties. From the fragmented archives, it appears the research base was intended to help combat a plague which was affecting their species. Given the state of the laboratory, it seems that initiative failed. \n\n Considering the original research, [Root.GetLeaderName] has suggested placing a facility in orbit to access the samples and the original research."
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.7.a:0 "Prudent."
