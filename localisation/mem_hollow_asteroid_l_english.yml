 #Anomaly Category Text
 mem_hollow_asteroid_category:0 "A Hollow Asteroid?"
 mem_hollow_asteroid_category_desc:0 "According to our scans this asteroid's mass is way too low for its enourmous size, suggesting that beneath the rock surface it might actually be hollow."
 
 #Light Failure
 mem_hollow_asteroid.1.name:0 "A Hollow Asteroid"
 mem_hollow_asteroid.1.desc:0 "The asteroid was indeed found to be hollow. In fact, it is not a single asteroid per se, but a group of several smaller asteroids that somehow got stuck together and were welded together by aeons of diffusion. A curious structure, though of little value."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.1.a:0 "Disappointing..."
 
 #Critical Failure
 mem_hollow_asteroid.2.name:0 "It was a Trap!"
 mem_hollow_asteroid.2.desc:0 "It appears that the hollow part of the asteroid was housing some kind of alien installation. However, as our science team managed to breach the wall, they apparently triggered some sort of self-destruct mechanism vaporising the asteroid alongside with them and their ship."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.2.a:0 "How terrible!"
 
 #Success: Space Mausoleum
 mem_hollow_asteroid.10.name:0 "Space Mausoleum"
 mem_hollow_asteroid.10.desc:0 "As our science team found its way inside, they discovered something unexpected: dead aliens. Over a hundred bodies are lined by the walls of the asteroids, dressed in ornamental clothes and accompanied with a variety of apparently everyday objects, preserved by the vacuum of space. Our analysis suggests that they all died over 300,000 years ago. This structure is an invaluable (and the only) source of knowledge about this mysterious alien species, their ways of life and their physiology."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.10.a:0 "We can learn a lot from this."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.10.b:0 "Haven't they heard of recycling?"
 mem_hollow_asteroid.10.c:0 "They were seeking to be close to the divine..."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.10.d:0 "Their customs were fascinating."
 
 #Success: Space Resort
 mem_hollow_asteroid.20.name:0 "Abandoned Space Resort"
 mem_hollow_asteroid.20.desc:0 "As our science team found its way inside, they discovered something unexpected: dead aliens. Over a hundred bodies are lined by the walls of the asteroids, dressed in ornamental clothes and accompanied with a variety of apparently everyday objects, preserved by the vacuum of space. Our analysis suggests that they all died over 300,000 years ago. This structure is an invaluable (and the only) source of knowledge about this mysterious alien species, their ways of life and their physiology."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.20.a:0 "Convert it into a commercial resort."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.20.b:0 "Ensure as many citizens as possible enjoy this place."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.20.c:0 "Dismantle the structure and study it."
 
 #Success: Ancient Art Exhibition
 mem_hollow_asteroid.30.name:0 "Ancient Art Exhibition"
 mem_hollow_asteroid.30.desc:0 "Our scientists have found something very strange. The inner walls of the asteroids are dotted with thousands of large crystals covered in pictogram and geometrical patterns. Between different shapes, colours and carvings, the team could not find a single pair of identical crystals. Every single crystal is now imaged for the archives, but what their creator was trying to say might forever remain a mystery."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.30.a:0 "Those a gorgeous."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.30.b:0 "If nothing else, it is a good exercise in set theories."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.30.c:0 "A fitting tribute to the miracles of creation."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.30.d:0 "If only its creators were still around to share their vision with us..."
 
 #Success: Panopticon
 mem_hollow_asteroid.40.name:0 "Panopticon"
 mem_hollow_asteroid.40.desc:0 "When the science team breached the interior of the asteroid, they found countless small living pods fixed on the outer wall. Large sphere is fixed in the centre allowing clear view on every pod. It appears, the asteroid was used by an unknown to us ancient species as a high security prison, under the idea that a handful of guards could covertly observe the inmates and remains of both are still littering structures. From data traces pulled from the station's computers, it appears that a faulty software update has locked inhabitants out of the system, leaving them to starve. Although it's not clear why they weren't rescued or have their bodies recovered."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.40.a:0 "We should study this prison's design."
 
 #Success: Kraken Quest Start
 mem_hollow_asteroid.50.name:0 "Abandoned Project"
 mem_hollow_asteroid.50.desc:0 "As our science team progressed inside the hollow asteroid, they found a complex tunnel system, leading towards a hollow core. Clearly artificially designed, they are lined with cables, support pylons and large canisters of unknown purpose, sealed shut and resistant to opening. A small orb is concealed deep inside the asteroid, containing data terminals. It will take time to decode the information they may contain, however."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.50.a:0 "Get onto it."
 
 #Project finished
 mem_hollow_asteroid.51.name:0 "Kraken in Making"
 mem_hollow_asteroid.51.desc:0 "The data we pulled from terminals inside [Asteroid] contains information that is both incredible and highly disturbing. This entire place was suppose to become a body of powerful being, referred to as Kraken, product of genetic engineering by an ancient spacefaring race. The core and the tunnels are to be filled with organic tissue grown from gene seed preserved inside canisters. Self-propelled, self-sustaning and under its creator's mental control, it would be able to take on entire fleets by itself and win.\n\nIt appears, however, that this project was unfinished. The age of canisters caused genetic damage to the Kraken gene seed making it unusable. However, with its incredible regenerative capacity, introduction of tissue from another Kraken could repair it and allow us creation of our own beast."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.51.a:0 "Try finding another Kraken to harvest..."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.51.b:0 "Scuttle the project. Some things are better left untouched..."
