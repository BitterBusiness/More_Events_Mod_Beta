 mem_hollow_asteroid_category:0 "A Hollow Asteroid?"
 mem_hollow_asteroid_category_desc:0 "According to our scans this asteroid's mass is way too low for its enourmous size, suggesting that beneath the rock surface it might actually be hollow."
 
 #Light Failure
 mem_hollow_asteroid.1.name:0 "A Hollow Asteroid"
 mem_hollow_asteroid.1.desc:0 "The asteroid was indeed found to be hollow. In fact, it is not a single asteroid per se, but a group of several smaller asteroids that somehow got stuck together and were welded together by aeons of diffusion. A curious structure, though of little value."

 #Critical Failure
 mem_hollow_asteroid.2.name:0 "It was a Trap!"
 mem_hollow_asteroid.2.desc:0 "It appears that the hollow part of the asteroid was housing some kind of alien installation. However, as our science team managed to breach the wall, they apparently triggered some sort of self-destruct mechanism vaporising the asteroid alongside with them and their ship."

 #Success: Space Mausoleum
 mem_hollow_asteroid.10.name:0 "Space Mausoleum"
 mem_hollow_asteroid.10.desc:0 "As our science team found its way inside, they discovered something unexpected: dead aliens. Over a hundred bodies are lined by the walls of the asteroids, dressed in ornamental clothes and accompanied with a variety of apparently everyday objects, preserved by the vacuum of space. Our analysis suggests that they all died over 300,000 years ago. This structure is an invaluable (and the only) source of knowledge about this mysterious alien species, their ways of life and their physiology."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.10.a:0 "We can learn a lot from this."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.10.b:0 "Haven't they heard of recycling?"
 mem_hollow_asteroid.10.c:0 "They were seeking to be close to the divine..."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.10.d:0 "Their customs were fascinating."

 mem_hollow_asteroid.20.a:0 "Convert it into a commercial resort."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.20.b:0 "Ensure as many citizens as possible enjoy this place."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.20.c:0 "Dismantle the structure and study it."
 
 #Success: Ancient Art Exhibition
 mem_hollow_asteroid.30.name:0 "Ancient Art Exhibition"
 mem_hollow_asteroid.30.desc:0 "Our scientists have found something very strange. The inner walls of the asteroids are dotted with thousands of large crystals covered in pictogram and geometrical patterns. Between different shapes, colours and carvings, the team could not find a single pair of identical crystals. Every single crystal is now imaged for the archives, but what their creator was trying to say might forever remain a mystery."
