 #Scientific Exploration Event Text
 mem_scientific_exploration.1.name:0 "Erudite Explorers"
 mem_scientific_exploration.1.desc:0 "A hail from just outside [home_system.GetName]'s outermost planet reveals the presence of a scientific expedition. The mixed-species crew explains that they are peaceful explorers on a hunt for ancient alien artifacts, and their search has led them to [home_planet.GetName]. They claim that there is a complex rock formation on the surface of the planet that may be more than it seems. This "Stonehenge" as they call it, may be a long dormant energy generator of enormous potential. They claim to have significant financial backing to purchase the artifact, and also offer to aid in the research efforts of [Root.GetName] if they are permitted to remove it. There has, however, been resistance from certain factions on [home_planet.GetName] who would rather not see a famous landmark abducted by aliens."
 mem_scientific_exploration.1.a:0 "Fascinating! Of course we will assist the pursuit of knowledge!"
 mem_scientific_exploration.1.b:0 "We should harness this energy for ourselves!"
 mem_scientific_exploration.1.c:0 "No alien will ever be permitted to defile our holy sites!"
 mem_scientific_exploration.2.name:0 "Wave of Obscurantism"
 mem_scientific_exploration.2.desc:0 "Our holy prophets, in their divine righteousness, have chosen to protect our most sacred of holy sites from the prying tentacles of blasphemous alien scientists. The blessed people of [Root.GetName] rejoice, yet some deviant elements question the suppression of science, and openly debate the validity of certain aspects of the holy texts! All true believers rally behind [Root.GetLeaderName]'s decision, but the visiting scientific expedition continues to stir dissent. They must be dealt with!"
 mem_scientific_exploration.2.a:0 "The word of the prophet is law!"
 mem_scientific_exploration.2.b:0 "Perhaps a compromise can be reached?"
 mem_scientific_exploration.2.c:0 "These Blasphemers can no longer be allowed to spread their heresy!"
