 mem_lost_protege_event.1.desc:0 "A respected xenobiologist on [Root.Capital.GetName] recently developed a theory that certain genetic and epigenetic markers in [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] indicate that we are significantly more biologically distinct from other species on our homeworld than is typical for sentient species. While most other experts dismiss this theory as meaningless statistical noise, the theory has developed a small but fervent following claiming this as proof that our species is destined for a special role in the galaxy."
