 # Initial Anomaly Text
 mem_matrix_category:0 "Ancient Structure"
 mem_matrix_category_desc:0 "Orbital scans of §Y[From.GetName]§! have detected an ancient structure on this devastated world which seems to be still intact. Further investigation is needed."
 
 # Matrix Anomaly Success
 mem_matrix.1.name:0 "Shocking Revelation"
 mem_matrix.1.desc:0 "This ancient building complex is being maintained by some rudimentary AI. Our team was not hindered to enter the building and the computersystem did not seem to take any notice of them at all. Deeper inside the complex a shocking revelation awaited our scientists. Thousands of humanoid beeings confined in some sort of pod-like structures and connected to the central computer. They show very high levels of brain activity. The system seems to keep these inhabitants alive while being confined in the pods even breeding replacements to compensate losses. Chief scientist §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! believes it will take some time to study the databases and find out what the meaning of this place is."
 mem_matrix.1.a:0 "Go on."
 
 # Matrix Anomaly Failure
 mem_matrix.2.name:0 "Just a Malfunction"
 mem_matrix.2.desc:0 "There must have been a scanner malfunction. Our survey team found nothing but large debris and ruins at the determined location."
 mem_matrix.2.a:0 "Well, let's move on."
 
 # Matrix Anomaly Critical Failure
 mem_matrix.3.name:0 "Ancient Defense Grid"
 mem_matrix.3.desc:0 "When §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! and the rest of his survey team entered the ancient structure they unknowingly activated an automatic defense system. Their following distress call was drowned by heavy gun fire and the collapsing of the building itself. None of them made it out alive..."
 mem_matrix.3.a:0 "Horrible!"
 
 # Matrix Complex Investigation Project
 MEM_MATRIX_INVESTIGATION:0 "Ancient Complex"
 MEM_MATRIX_INVESTIGATION_DESC:0 "Our Scientists want to study the systems in the ancient complex found on §Y[From.GetName]§."
 
 # Get the building and some research
 mem_matrix.5.name:0 "Neural Network"
 mem_matrix.5.desc:0 "Further investigation of the stored data revealed some shocking details about this complex. It once was some sort of prison as well as a science institute specialised in neural connections and AI research. Their greatest triumph backfired horribly when the selfaware AI decided to do its own research using the planetary arsenal of nuclear weaponry to purged the entire planet of life except for its own assets. From then on it became more and more passive, creating multiple layers of realities for its prisoners to experience to keep them pacified believing to live a normal life unaware of the truth of their situation. The AI itself has become obsessed over the idea of being just a part of a program in another plane of existence and ceased any outside interactions ever since leaving a giant computer without purpose."
 mem_matrix.5.a:0 "Very interesting."
 
 # Matrix Complex Building Description
 mem_matrix_building:0 "Neural Computer Complex"
 mem_matrix_building_desc:0 "An ancient research complex - housing thousands of connected beings - working as a giant computer."
