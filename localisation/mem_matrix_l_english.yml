 # Initial Anomaly Text
 mem_matrix_category:0 "Ancient Structure"
 mem_matrix_category_desc:0 "Orbital scans of §Y[From.GetName]§! have detected an ancient structure on this devastated world which seems to be still intact. Further investigation is needed."
 
 # Matrix Anomaly Success
 mem_matrix.1.name:0 "Shocking Revelation"
 mem_matrix.1.desc:0 "This ancient building complex is being maintained by some rudimentary AI. Our entered the building and the computer system did not seem to take any notice. Deeper inside the complex a shocking revelation awaited our scientists. Thousands of humanoid aliens confined in pod-like structures and connected to the central computer. They show very high levels of brain activity. The system seems to keep these inhabitants alive while being confined in the pods even breeding replacements to compensate for losses. Chief scientist §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! believes it will take some time to study the databases and find out what the meaning of this place is."
 mem_matrix.1.a:0 "Go on."
 
 # Matrix Anomaly Failure
 mem_matrix.2.name:0 "Just a Malfunction"
 mem_matrix.2.desc:0 "There must have been a scanner malfunction. Our survey team found nothing but ruins and debris at the determined location."
 mem_matrix.2.a:0 "Well, let's move on."
 
 # Matrix Anomaly Critical Failure
 mem_matrix.3.name:0 "Ancient Defense Grid"
 mem_matrix.3.desc:0 "When §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! and the rest of his survey team entered the ancient structure they unknowingly activated an automatic defense system. Their distress call was drowned by heavy gun fire and the collapsing of the building itself. None of them made it out alive..."
 mem_matrix.3.a:0 "Horrible!"
 
 # Matrix Complex Investigation Project
 MEM_MATRIX_INVESTIGATION:0 "Ancient Complex"
 MEM_MATRIX_INVESTIGATION_DESC:0 "Our Scientists want to study the systems in the ancient complex found on §Y[From.GetName]§."
 
 # Get the building and some research
 mem_matrix.5.name:0 "Neural Network"
 mem_matrix.5.desc:0 "Further analysis of the stored data revealed the history of this complex. It once was some sort of prison as well as a science institute specialised in neural connections and AI research. Their greatest triumph backfired horribly when their first self-aware AI used the planetary arsenal of nuclear weaponry to perform its own research.  The resulting conflagration purged the entire planet of life - except for the contents of this facility. From then, the AI slowly rewrote itself, becoming more and more passive, creating multiple layers of realities for its prisoners to experience to keep them pacified, believing they were living a normal life and unaware of the truth of their situation. The AI itself has become obsessed with the idea that reality is an illusion - that it is not a computer but a simulation of one, just a part of a program in another plane of existence."
 mem_matrix.5.a:0 "Very interesting."
 
 # Matrix Complex Building Description
 mem_matrix_building:0 "Neural Computer Complex"
 mem_matrix_building_desc:0 "An ancient research complex - housing thousands of connected beings - working as a giant computer."
