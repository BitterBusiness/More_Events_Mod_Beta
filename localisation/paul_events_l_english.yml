paul_star_survey.1.name:0 "Survey The Stars"
paul_star_survey.1.desc:0 "For the first time in history we have a chance to see the stars up-close. Many of our best scientists are eager to study them and prove the standing theories on the processes that create and fuel them. The insights gained may lead to scientific breakthroughs. We already have a list of most interesting stars for survey."
paul_star_survey.1.a:0 "Let's see that list..."
paul_star_survey.1.b:0 "Our best scientists have better things to do"
paul_star_survey.2.name:0 "A-class star studied"
paul_star_survey.2.desc:0 "This very bright star is relatively short-lived, as the fusion process in it's core is extremely fast. During studies science officer [Root.GetLeaderName] got an interesting idea. Setting up a network of specialized satelites could let us syphon at least a bit of the power of this star. His assistant pointed out that alternatively, similar setup could be used to gather data on radiation spectra and fusion reaction."
paul_star_survey.2.a:0 "Let's use the satelites for energy"
paul_star_survey.2.b:0 "Let's study this star more"
paul_star_survey.3.name:0 "K-class star studied"
paul_star_survey.3.desc:0 "Just as we expected the radiation spectrum of this star is very conductive to carbon-oxygen life similar to us. The zone of perfect conditions is wide. We should look for this stars in the future as they have high potential of having colonizable planets."
paul_star_survey.4.name:0 "M-class star studied"
paul_star_survey.4.desc:0 "This red dwarf is an old star with very slow fusion reaction. The lower levels of radiation and slower, less violent fusion reaction in the core of this star let us understand the process better."
paul_star_survey.5.name:0 "Dead star studied"
paul_star_survey.5.desc:0 "This was once a giant star that went supernova and it's core colapsed into itself creating this rare celestial object of unique properties. This is the destiny of many stars of our home sky. While studying the exotic radiation, our science officer [Root.GetLeaderName] found new fascination in Particle Research."
paul_star_survey.6.name:0 "Star studies completed"
paul_star_survey.6.desc.spirit:0 "We have finally finished our studies of different types of stars. The data collected, as well as pictures made by our researchers gave us new apreciation for the lights that shine in vast darkness of space. We instructed our preachers to share this insights with general population."
paul_star_survey.6.desc.mat:0 "We have finally finished our studies of different types of stars. Special research group was formed to further analyze all the collected data. The group could focus on furthering our understanding of physical processess that happen in the stars core. One of our science officers suggested however, that their time could be better used to fine tune our powerplants. Such tuning would put us above the projected energetic budget for a couple of years, which leads directly to increased energy credit."

paul_star_survey.6.a:0 "Let's push the limits of our technology"
paul_star_survey.6.b:0 "We could always use more energy..."
paul_star_survey.6.c:0 "May the light guide us"
