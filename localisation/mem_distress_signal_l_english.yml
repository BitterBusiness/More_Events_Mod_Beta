As the wreckage was already partially overgrown by the local flora our team was smitten with suprise when suddenly a single survivor greeted them.\n\nThe survivor identifies himself as the former captain of the now derelict ship. They where send on a scientific mission to explore formerly unknown worlds and stellar mysteries. Their mission progressed well until they found a strange gravitational anomaly in an asteroid belt. According to the survivor it must have been some kind of unstable wormhole that pulled their ship out of normal space. When they regained consciousness their ship was disabled and adrift, slowly entering the atmosphere of a planet they had never seen before. They are not even sure to still be in the same galaxy as there are no known reference points to be found. Without any company aside from his loyal ai assistant he still managed to live off this alien world for more than two years.\n\nWith little hope to ever return home again the survivor offers his service as a scientific officer in return for accommodation."

Living underground, it travels considerable distances by eating its way through rocks and soil and occasionally resurface to hunt and absorb solar light for sustenance. It appears it has swallowed a small commercial ship that landed on the planet but its digestive system was maladapted to diet of refined metal and space-age plastic, causing it to get stuck in creature's body and eventually causing death by bowel obstruction."
