 mem_abandoned_mecha_category_desc:0 "The world of [From.GetName] is in a nuclear winter, which has lasted for around 800 years according to radiometric dating. Like all tomb worlds, it is covered in ruins of the civilization that once graced its surface. However, many of these, some of which are visible from orbit, cannot be compared to any previously discovered archaeological sites."

 mem_abandoned_mecha.10.name:0 "Abandoned Mecha"
 mem_abandoned_mecha.10.desc:0 "It would appear as though the defunct civilization on [From.GetName] had been in a state of worldwide war long before the invention of nuclear weapons. Before the breakthroughs were made that allowed such devices to even be theorized, they invested a considerable amount of effort into making bigger and better weapons of war. In particular, they developed armoured bipedal and quadrupedal machines, similar to tanks, which have quickly become referred to as "mecha".\n\nAfter several decades of waging war with these machines, nuclear power was discovered, and atomic weapons were promptly designed. With no time to build up a large stockpile on each side and therefore form the concept of mutually assured destruction, bombs were dropped the moment they were built. By the time they realized the long-term effects of such weapons, it was too late.\n\nNow, the abandoned mecha litter the surface. While most of the technology found in the ruins is already known to us, the mecha provide an all new outlook of mechanics. Since so many can be found half-built, fully intact, and half-destroyed, we have plenty of opportunities to research them."

 mem_abandoned_mecha.20.desc:0 "The unusual ruins on [From.From.GetName] are nothing more than just that: unusual ruins. It would appear as their now extinct builders had an interesting architectural style. Unfortunately, the buildings are far too deteriorated to be studied."
 mem_abandoned_mecha.20.a:0 "Very well."
