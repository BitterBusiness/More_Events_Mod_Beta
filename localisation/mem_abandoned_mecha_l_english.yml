 mem_abandoned_mecha_category_desc:0 "The world of [From.GetName] is in a nuclear winter, which has already lasted for around 800 years according to radiometric dating. It is covered in ruins of the civilization that once graced its surface. However, many of these, some of which are even visible from orbit, appear unlike any previously discovered archaeological sites."

 mem_abandoned_mecha.10.name:0 "Abandoned Mecha"
 mem_abandoned_mecha.10.desc:0 "It would appear as though the defunct civilizations on [From.GetName] had been in a state of worldwide war long before the invention of nuclear weapons. According to Scientist [Root.GetLeaderName]'s findings, before nuclear technology could even be theorized, they invested considerable effort into making bigger and deadlier conventional weapons of war. In particular, they developed armoured bipedal, tripedal, and quadrupedal machines, similar to tanks, which have quickly become referred to as "mecha".\n\nWe have translated records indicating that after several decades of waging war with these machines, nuclear fission was discovered. The balance of power shifted, and atomic weapons were promptly designed. With no time to build up a large stockpile on each side (and thereby form the concept of mutually assured destruction), bombs were dropped as soon as they were available. These civilizations first discovered the long-term effects of such weapons through direct experience, at which point it was too late.\n\nNow the abandoned mecha litter the surface. While most of the technology found in the ruins is outdated from our perspective, the mecha provide an all new outlook of mechanics. Since so many can be found half-built, fully intact, and half-destroyed, we have plenty of opportunities to research them."

 mem_abandoned_mecha.20.desc:0 "The unusual ruins on [From.From.GetName] are nothing more than just that: unusual ruins. It would appear as their now extinct builders had an interesting architectural style. Unfortunately, the buildings are far too deteriorated to be studied."
 mem_abandoned_mecha.20.a:0 "Very well."
