 #TODO: desc_01 doesn't seem to be working
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.desc_01:0 "Ah...At long last you have finally come."
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.desc_02:0 "Greed had poisoned their souls, had barricaded their world with hate, had goose-stepped them into misery and bloodshed. They had developed speed, but had shut themselves in. Machinery that gave them abundance had left them in want. Their knowledge had made them cynical; their cleverness, hard and unkind. They thought too much and felt too little. More than machinery they needed fellowship. More than cleverness, they needed kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, their way of life was violent, and they threatened the lives of others." 
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.a:0 "Who are you?"
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.a.response:0 "I am Chap'Lin, the last of the Orila. Though I am merely an image of his consciousness and not the person himself. He was once chosen by his people to represent our species to those who would follow in our footsteps."
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.b:0 "What exactly are you?"
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.b.response:0 "I am an image of the consciousness of the Orila Chap'Lin. I am more than a mere AI but less than a living being. To be what I am is a honor as well as a burden...A burden I readily chose to accept. Since the last of our race passed away it has been my responsibility to maintain what has been left of this world and to ensure the continuous function of its planetary barrier shield. But my most important task has been to wait for your arrival."
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.c:0 "What happened to your race?"
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.c.response:0 "There was a time in which our technological progress outmatched our ability to forsee possible consequences. We recklessly persued our quest for immortality. Once we became aware of the consequences the damage was already done. Continuous cloning had left our race sterile and slowly succumbing to the inevitable degradation of our cloned material."
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.d:0 "Why did you uplift other species?"
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.d.response:0 "When we faced our inevitable demise we saw that there was no other civilisation ready or willing to protect less advanced species against ruthless aggression. So we tried to help such species find their way to the stars so they would be able to defend themselves and perhaps one day succeed us in our position as protectors."

 mem_ea_uplifter.16.desc:0 "We did not want to have an empire. That was not our way. We did not want to rule or conquer anyone. We would have liked to help everyone if possible. All intelligent life should want to help one another. We all want to live by each others' happiness, not by each others' misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. We believed that in this universe there was room for everyone, and that our galaxy was rich and could provide for everyone; that the way of life could be free and beautiful. But others lost the way..."
 mem_ea_uplifter.16.a:0 "Lost the way?"
