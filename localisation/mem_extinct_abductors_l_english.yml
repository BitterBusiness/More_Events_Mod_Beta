 mem_extinct_abductors.2.desc:0 "Our survey team has found nothing of interest. The place is stripped clean of any valuable or interesting things. If the former holders left this place in an orderly fashion or later scavengers picked up all leftovers remains unclear."

 # Extinct Abductors Anomaly Critical Failure
 mem_extinct_abductors.3.name:0 "A Noble Sacrifice"
 mem_extinct_abductors.3.desc:0 "In the deeps of the complex on §Y[From.GetName]§! our survey team got into contact with a strange substance that later turned out to be a dangerous mutagen the former holders of this place had experimented with. Back aboard the ship members of the survey team began to transform into twisted abominations, insane from pain and rage. These mutations spread like wildfire aboard the ship and as things got completely out of control chief scientist §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! managed to set a collision course with the planet. The following FTL impact destroyed big parts of §Y[From.GetName]§! including the building complex the team had investigated earlier - thus averting any further threat."

 # Extinct Abductors Anomaly Success
 mem_ea_uplifter.1.name:0 "A Startling Find"
 mem_ea_uplifter.1.desc:0 "The complex on §Y[From.GetName]§! must have been subject to heavy orbital bombardment yet it is still mostly intact. That said the interior is in a bad shape. Our team struggled to navigate though the labyrinth of blocked hallways and half collapsed rooms. Their efforts however were rewarded when they found a big hall three levels below the ground filled with thousands of cryopods occupied by the remains of various different species lying here for millennia. Our team was staggered when they realized that some of them were of §Y[Root.GetSpeciesAdj]§! origin."

 mem_ea_uplifter.2.name:0 "Frozen Past"
 mem_ea_uplifter.2.desc:0 "Our scientists could identify atleast five other species besides our own inside those cryopods. The most common one - a bipedal species of small stature - is regarded as the builder of this place by our team. The fact that they all lie here in the same room raises questions. Had they all been here out of free will?\n\nFrom what our scientists could reconstruct of the central computers data memory the answer seems to be yes. Our fragmentary informations indicates something like an enormous uplifting project beeing persued by this place's owners. They also found the coordinates of the other four species homeplanets. We should investigate them, while another team keeps investigating the remains of the data storage."

 # Dialogue with the AI System of the Uplifter Race
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.name:0 "The Last Orila"
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.desc_01:0 "Ah...At long last you have finally come."
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.desc_02:0 "Greed had poisoned their souls, had barricaded their world with hate, had goose-stepped them into misery and bloodshed. They had developed speed, but had shut themselves in. Machinery that gave them abundance had left them in want. Their knowledge had made them cynical; their cleverness, hard and unkind. They thought too much and felt too little. More than machinery they needed fellowship. More than cleverness, they needed kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, their way of life was violent, and they threatened the lives of others." 
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.a:0 "And we were one of these races you tried to uplift?"
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.b:0 "Who are you?"
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.b.response:0 "I am Chap'Lin, the last of the Orila. Though I am merely an image of his consciousness and not the person himself. He was once chosen by his people to represent our species to those who would follow in our footsteps."
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.c:0 "What exactly are you?"
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.c.response:0 "I am an image of the consciousness of the Orila Chap'Lin. I am more than a mere AI but less than a living being. To be what I am is a honor as well as a burden...A burden I readily chose to accept. Since the last of our race passed away it has been my responsibility to maintain what has been left of this world and to ensure the continuous function of its planetary barrier shield. But my most important task has been to wait for your arrival."
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.d:0 "What happened to your race?"
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.d.response:0 "There was a time in which our technological progress outmatched our ability to forsee possible consequences. We recklessly persued our quest for immortality. Once we became aware of the consequences the damage was already done. Continuous cloning had left our race sterile and slowly succumbing to the inevitable degradation of our gene pool."
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.e:0 "Why did you uplift other species?"
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.e.response:0 "When we faced our inevitable demise we saw that there was no other civilisation ready or willing to protect less advanced species against ruthless aggression. So we tried to help such species find their way to the stars so they would be able to defend themselves and perhaps one day succeed us in our position as protectors."

All intelligent life should want to help one another. We all want to live by each others' happiness, not by each others' misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. We believed that in this universe there was room for everyone, and that our galaxy was rich and could provide for everyone; that the way of life could be free and beautiful. But others lost the way..."
