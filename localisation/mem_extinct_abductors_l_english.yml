 mem_extinct_abductors.3.desc:0 "In the depths of the complex on §Y[From.GetName]§! our survey team was contaminated with a strange substance that they later discovered to be a dangerous mutagen the former holders of this place had experimented with. Back aboard the ship members of the survey team began to transform into twisted abominations, insane from pain and rage. These mutations spread like wildfire aboard the ship and as things got completely out of control chief scientist §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! managed to set a collision course with the planet. The following FTL impact destroyed big parts of §Y[From.GetName]§! including the complex the team had investigated earlier - thus averting any further threat."

 mem_ea_uplifter.1.name:0 "A Startling Find"
 mem_ea_uplifter.1.desc:0 "The complex on §Y[From.GetName]§! must have been subject to heavy orbital bombardment yet it is still mostly intact. That said the interior is in bad shape. Our team struggled to navigate though the labyrinth of blocked hallways and half collapsed rooms. Their efforts were rewarded however when they found a big hall three levels underground filled with thousands of cryopods occupied by the remains of various species lying there for millennia. Some of these specimens are of §Y[Root.GetSpeciesAdj]§! origin!"

 mem_ea_uplifter.2.name:0 "Frozen Past"
 mem_ea_uplifter.2.desc:0 "Our scientists identified at least five other species besides our own inside those cryopods. The most common one - a bipedal species of small stature - is regarded as the builder of this place by our team. The fact that they all lie in the same room raises questions. Were they all in this place out of free will?\n\nFrom what our scientists could reconstruct of the central computer's data memory the answer seems to be yes. Our fragmentary information indicates something like an enormous uplifting project was being pursued by this place's owners. They also found the coordinates of the other four species' home planets. We should investigate them, while another team keeps investigating the remains of the data storage."

There are crystal formations rarely more then one or two metres in width and height littering the whole planets surface with few dozen metres distance between them.\n\nShortly after they took samples of one of those formations the §Y[Root.GetName]§! detected an incoming hostile signal at the edge of the solar system.

Our science team only found small traces of what was once the dominant species on this planet. Their end was inevitable from the moment the crystal first appeared. Their techology must have been far too primitive for them to possess any means of defense against it. The small crystal formations seem to have exhausted the planet's crust of most useful minerals thus turning the planet from a once living world into a lifeless wasteland.\n\nNow that the giant crystal has been destroyed our scientists suggest two possible options. We could either harvest these mineral rich crystal formations or study their undisturbed growing process."

 # Dialogue with the AI System of the Uplifter Race

 mem_ea_uplifter.15.desc_02:0 "Greed had poisoned their souls, had barricaded their world with hate, had goose-stepped them into misery and bloodshed. They had developed speed, but had shut themselves in. Machinery that gave them abundance had left them in want. Their knowledge had made them cynical; their cleverness, hard and unkind. They thought too much and felt too little. More than machinery they needed fellowship. More than cleverness, they needed kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, their way of life was violent, and they threatened the lives of others." 
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.a:0 "And we were one of these races you tried to uplift?"
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.b:0 "Who are you?"
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.b.response:0 "I am Chap'Lin, the last of the Orila. Though I am merely an image of his consciousness and not the person himself. He was once chosen by his people to represent our species to those who would follow in our footsteps."
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.c:0 "What exactly are you?"
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.c.response:0 "I am an image of the consciousness of the Orila Chap'Lin. I am more than a mere AI but less than a living being. To be what I am is a honor as well as a burden...A burden I readily chose to accept. Since the last of our race passed away it has been my responsibility to maintain what has been left of this world and to ensure the continuous function of its planetary barrier shield. But my most important task has been to wait for your arrival."
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.d:0 "What happened to your race?"
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.d.response:0 "There was a time in which our technological progress outmatched our ability to forsee possible consequences. We recklessly persued our quest for immortality. Once we became aware of the consequences the damage was already done. Continuous cloning had left our race sterile and slowly succumbing to the inevitable degradation of our gene pool."
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.e:0 "Why did you uplift other species?"
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.e.response:0 "When we faced our inevitable demise we saw that there was no other civilisation ready or willing to protect less advanced species against ruthless aggression. So we tried to help such species find their way to the stars so they would be able to defend themselves and perhaps one day succeed us in our position as protectors."
