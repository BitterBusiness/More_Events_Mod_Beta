 mem_accelerated_evolution.1.desc:0 "After several months of living on §Y[Root.GetName]§!, the colonists have noticed something odd about the surrounding environment. Species seen one year were drastically different the next. Upon order of the colony's administration a quick study was performed which showed incredibly fast evolutionary processes from the planet's flora and fauna. A unique process of both sexual and asexual reproduction found in all the species on the world plus a quicker than average life cycle seems to be the cause behind this unusual situation.\n\nOn one hand, repeatedly adapting to the local biosphere prevents the colonists from ever truly fitting in; nothing with a normal evolutionary cycle could. On the other, constant evolution and rapid breeding from the local animals leads to advancements in farming and evolutionary science. Either way, the biosphere of a planet is too complicated to change on this sort of scale. The colonists are saddled with this for good or bad."
