 mem_ancient_factory.10.desc:0 "The rock formations on [From.GetName] are not rock formations at all, according to a survey by Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName]. They are, in fact, some sort of automated mega-factory, constructed by unknown makers, and abandoned long ago judging by its rundown state. Despite being far too decayed to be repurposed for our own needs, further study of the complex could be useful for our own factories and automation systems."

 mem_ancient_factory.20.desc:0 "The unusual rock formations on [From.From.GetName] are just that; unusual rock formations. They appear to be some sort of self-contained badlands, too small for our scanners to have registered as a fully-fledged region."
