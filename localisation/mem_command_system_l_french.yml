 mem_command_system.1.name:0 "Système de Commande Souterrain"
 mem_command_system.1.desc:0 "§Y[From.From.GetName]§! est devenu un monde tombeau 30 000 ans plus tôt selon les scans des radiations dans l'atomsphère. En dessous des ruines des villes et des installations militaires d'une des nations les plus grandes de ce monde peuvent être trouvées d'immenses cages d'ascenseur menant à un réseau souterrain de plusieurs kilomètres en dessous de la surface.\n\n§Y[This.GetLeaderName]§! rapporte que ce réseau de tunnels et de stations constitue une sorte de voie ferrée géante. It would appear that its creators intended for the railway, which they called the \"Command System\", to be used as a kind of fallout shelter. By continually moving, the Command System could avoid attack from earth-penetrating weapons or \"EPWs\". However, the railway's creators seemed to have vastly underestimated the length of a nuclear winter as well as the long-term inhabitability due to nuclear fallout; after an average period of eighty years, each of the trains ran out of supplies, with their crews dying shortly after.\n\nNow, the abandoned trains rattle around below the surface of §Y[From.From.GetName]§!, still functional despite their incredible age. While the technology that went into them is outdated by our standards, studying the methods used to keep them running tens of thousands of years later could provide us with plenty of valuable information."
 mem_command_system.100.name:0 "Phantom Readings"
 mem_command_system.100.desc:0 "After much deliberation, §Y[This.GetLeaderName]§! and the crew of the §Y[This.GetName]§! have come to the conclusion that the seismic readings from §Y[From.From.GetName]§! are due to nothing more than a malfunctioning seismometer. On the plus side, this taught §Y[This.GetLeaderName]§! to be more careful in the future when researching anomalies; next time, this kind of oversight might lead to someone's death."
 #Note for translators: The next line is the beginning of an expression "fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me" which means "If someone tricks you it's their fault for being a jerk, but if someone tricks you more than once, you should have noticed that they were disposed to trickery and therefore not have fallen for it again."
