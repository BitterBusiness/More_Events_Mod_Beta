# Kicks off tomb world survey chain

 mem_tomb_survey.2.title:0 "Dead Worlds"
 mem_tomb_survey.2.desc:0 "In our travels through the galaxy, we have encountered many worlds whose peoples destroyed themselves before they reached the stars. In many cases, the reason for their self-destruction remains a mystery. Were these merely unlucky accidents? Were they caused by some flaw in their genetic or social makeup? Or is suicide the ultimate fate of all tool-using species?\n\nA group of xenosociologists on [Root.Capital.GetName] have proposed a series of archeological expeditions to try to answer these questions. By examining the charred remains of dead societies, we may be able to learn something of what led them to destruction - and how we can avoid their fate."
 mem_tomb_survey.2.a:0 "An excellent idea!"
 mem_tomb_survey.2.b:0 "We have other priorities at the present."

# Religious War

 mem_tomb_survey.11.title:0 "Dead Worlds: Nuclear Jihad"
 mem_tomb_survey.11.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] was the site of a religious war fought with nuclear weapons. The planet's surface is divided into two major continental masses; each continent came to be controlled by a single religion early in the local Bronze Age. Both cults had enjoyed complete dominance over their continent for roughly a millennium before they made contact, and they immediately came into conflict when they discovered each other's existence. The prolonged struggle slowly escalated as technology improved, culminating in a century-long global war with industrial-era weapons. Both sides developed bacteriological and, later, atomic weapons roughly contemporaneously, and both used them, extensively. Prolonged nuclear bombardment led to the collapse of the industrial infrastructure, but surviving military forces continued the war until utterly exhausted. The few survivors of a century of warfare ultimately died of starvation and plague as nuclear winter ravaged the globe."
 mem_tomb_survey.11.a:0 "Tragic."

# Asteroid Impact

 mem_tomb_survey.12.title:0 "Dead Worlds: Cosmic Accident"
 mem_tomb_survey.12.desc:0 "Contrary to initial reports, [Root.GetName] was never the site of nuclear conflict. In fact, recovered records show that the locals were astonishingly peaceful; there is no evidence of organized violent conflict since the early Bronze Age, when a philosophy of pacifism and mutually beneficial trade swept the planet. Instead, civilization ended here due to a catastrophic meteorite impact - the radiation we detected is due to fission reactors that broke open in the cataclysm. Tragically, the local inhabitants had just entered the Space Age when the meteorite struck, and in another decade or two would likely have been able to divert it before it hit."
 mem_tomb_survey.12.a:0 "How sad!"
 
# Science Experiment Accident

 mem_tomb_survey.13.title:0 "Dead Worlds: Dangerous Science"
 mem_tomb_survey.13.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] was not destroyed by a war - the cause of the disaster appears to have been a physics experiment that went horribly wrong. We cannot be sure, because the site of the experiment was completely vaporized, as well as everything for a hundred kilometers' around it, but a local scientist appears to have discovered the existence of warp fields by accident, a full century before most species do. A series of experiments followed, culminating in what the few surviving records describe as an attempt to open a gateway into another dimension. What exactly happened is not clear, but judging by the global blast and fire damage, pervasive radioactive contamination, and hundred-kilometer-wide crater where the laboratory used to be, we can assume it did not end well. In any event, besides archeological data, we have also recovered a considerable body of information our physicists will find interesting."
 mem_tomb_survey.13.a:0 "Regrettable."
 
 # Alien Attack

 mem_tomb_survey.14.title:0 "Dead Worlds: Murder"
 mem_tomb_survey.14.desc:0 "The race inhabiting [Root.GetName] did not commit suicide - they were murdered. The surviving remains are too scant to determine precisely what happened, but during the local Iron Age [Root.GetName] was bombarded from orbit, and the survivors finished off with biological weapons.\n\nThere is no indication of why this act of genocide was commited, or by whom."
 mem_tomb_survey.14.a:0 "How horrible!"
 
# Accidental War

 mem_tomb_survey.15.title:0 "Dead Worlds: A Terrible Mistake"
 mem_tomb_survey.15.desc:0 "At the time of the war, the race inhabiting [Root.GetName] was divided into two mutually hostile alliances on ideological grounds, each armed with nuclear weapons. They preserved a fragile peace for decades, each fearing mutual annihilation if they ever went to war. It was only as they were finally edging towards reconciliation and cooperation that war suddenly broke out, without any warning or buildup.\n\nOur archeological team spent months puzzling over how and why this occurred, before finally locating a deeply buried tunnel network containing one of the computers coordinating one of the alliance's defense networks. The tunnels collapsed when a nuclear warhead detonated on the surface above, but we were able to excavate and recover the computer. The cause of the war appears to have been a software error: a meteorite bursting over a missile radar site tricked the defense computer into believing the other alliance was attacking, triggering an automated retaliatory response. Everyone involved was dead before the mistake could be discovered."
 mem_tomb_survey.15.a:0 "How terrible!"

 mem_tomb_survey.20.desc_material:0 "After sifting through the remains of these vanished civilizations, we have found no simple explanation for why they ended as they did. Each case seems unique, a product of specific, tragic circumstances. Perhaps that is the lesson to be drawn here - that there is no grander pattern in history, and that the fate of any society is the product of its specific culture and situation.\n\nHowever, while we have not found any grand unifying theory of history, we have gathered a staggering amount of useful information which our scientists are still parsing through. [MEM_society_scientist.GetName] has proposed building a special archive to house the records and artifacts we scavenged from these planets, for the use of future scholars."
 mem_tomb_survey.20.desc_spiritual:0 "After sifting through the remains of these vanished civilizations, we have found no simple explanation for why they ended as they did. Malevolence, hubris, sin, the whim of fate - each death has a unique origin. Perhaps that is the lesson to be drawn here - that the grand meaning of history is known only to the gods, and we mere mortals cannot hope to understand the web of fate.\n\nHowever, while we have not found any grand unifying theory of history, we have learned much about the religions and beliefs of these lost civilizations. [MEM_society_scientist.GetName] has proposed building a special building to act as a place of remembrance for these gods that were once worshipped, and are now lost, to help us all remember the transience of our place in the universe."
