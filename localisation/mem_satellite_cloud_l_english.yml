  #Base
  mem_satellite_cloud_category:0 "Satellite Cloud"
  mem_satellite_cloud_category_desc:0 "Our sensors indicate the presence of multiple solid structures in close proximity to the star. Further scans are necessary."

  #Failure 1
  mem_satellite_cloud.201.name:0 "Observation Failed"
  mem_satellite_cloud.201.desc:0 "Scientist §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§ reports that although artificial objects are, without a doubt, present within star's corona, strong gravitational and electro-magnetic interference from the star makes observation, let alone salvage completely impossible. The mysterious objects are likely forever outside our grasp."

  #Failure 2
  mem_satellite_cloud.202.name:0 "Failed Retrieval"
  mem_satellite_cloud.202.desc:0 "Initial reports from Scientist §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§ indicate hundred of satellites orbiting the star. However, as the ship approached, it appears to have tripped some kind of proximity sensor causing the entire satellite cloud to turn on manoeuvre engines and plummet into the star. Even in unlikely event of their survival, they are now completely beyond recovery."

  #Critical Failure 1
  mem_satellite_cloud.301.name:0 "Observation Critically Failed"
  mem_satellite_cloud.301.desc:0 "§Y[Root.GetName]§ was not only unable to recover objects within star's corona, but in attempt to do so, flew too close to the star and was destroyed. The mysterious objects are likely forever outside our grasp."

  #Critical Failure 2
  mem_satellite_cloud.302.name:0 "Unmanned Drones Awoken"
  mem_satellite_cloud.302.desc:0 "We have received a distress signal from §Y[Root.GetName]§. The objects it was sent to observe turned out to be a swarm of unmanned drones, laying dormant in the sun's corona. Spurred by our ship's approach they reactivated and are assuming combat position."

  #Art Installation
  mem_satellite_cloud.1.name:0 "Art Installation"
  mem_satellite_cloud.1.desc:0 "Hundreds of prismatic objects have been placed around the star, each having a unique shape and structure, allowing starlight to pass through them to be dispersed in unusual spectral patterns. Most of the elements appear to have been knocked out of alignment over time, but even what little still remains can only be described as \"mesmerising.\""

  #Solarium
  mem_satellite_cloud.2.name:0 "Solarium"
  mem_satellite_cloud.2.desc:0 "Our observation revealed hundreds of habitat satellites suspended over [Star] via advanced solar sails. A Notable feature of each of them is a transparent dome turned towards the star, suggesting incredible heat-tolerance, if not dependence of their creators. Now abandoned and seemingly falling apart, these satellites cannot be safely recovered. However, our scientists should be able to extract useful structural data by remote scans."

  #Cloud Computing
  mem_satellite_cloud.3.name:0 "Cloud Computing"
  mem_satellite_cloud.3.desc:0 "After more thorough scans our science team reports about a vast network of advanced energy-scooping satellites orbiting the star. According to §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§ they appear to be linked with super-tensile fibre-optics suggesting that energy they absorb was used to perform calculations of some sort. Although these satellites themselves are damaged beyond repair or recovering, their technology offered us an insight into advanced computation."

  #Observatory
  mem_satellite_cloud.4.name:0 "Observatory"
  mem_satellite_cloud.4.desc:0 "§Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§ reports about hundreds of parabolic antennae orbiting the star and directed outward. It appears the satellite cloud channelled enormous amounts of energy from the star to send outward signals, as well as process incoming signals. Although damaged beyond repair or recovery, the satellite cloud provided us with valuable insight into stellar observation techniques."

  #Scrap Metal
  mem_satellite_cloud.5.name:0 "Scrap Metal"
  mem_satellite_cloud.5.desc:0 "A massive cloud of debris orbits the star. Likely, they were once a network of satellites, now eroded by harsh conditions of proximity to the star nearly beyond recognition. But even mangled husks of this alien technology can be, if nothing else, recovered and processed by our industry."
  mem_satellite_cloud.5.a:0 "That's useful."

  #Stellar Converter
  mem_satellite_cloud.6.name:0 "Stellar Converter"
  mem_satellite_cloud.6.desc:0 "Hundreds of solar panels positioned near the star and linked to massive energy converter nodes seem to have once been used to channel enormous amounts of solar energy elsewhere, however in their current state they can not be safely re-activated or recovered. Still, the surviving systems provided us with valuable insight into advanced energy manipulation."

  #Stellar Scoop
  mem_satellite_cloud.7.name:0 "Stellar Scoop"
  mem_satellite_cloud.7.desc:0 "Our observation revealed hundreds of advanced stations, syphoning charged overheated plasma from star's corona. Deposed in large containers, it was likely supposed to be loaded on ships and delivered to places of processing. Unfortunately these stations appear to be unmaintained for ages as most of the storage containers are cracked and leaking. The entire system is too unstable to be safely repaired or manipulated. However, the easily accessible plasma will be a boon for our industry."
  mem_satellite_cloud.7.a:0 "That's useful"

  #Pyrovore Colony
  mem_satellite_cloud.8.name:0 "Pyrovore Colony"
  mem_satellite_cloud.8.desc:0 "The unknown structures were revealed to be large transparent domes turned towards the star suggesting they were used as some sort of greenhouses or hydroponic labs. Most of them are broken and lifeless, but bizzarely, on some life seems to thrive despite (or perhaps because of) the harsh conditions of solar proximity. Somehow adapted to extreme heat and vacuum of space large colonies of primitive organisms are covering the hulls of multiple satellites. It would likely be impossible to move samples of those organisms away, but even remote observation would be invaluable to study their unique adaptations."
