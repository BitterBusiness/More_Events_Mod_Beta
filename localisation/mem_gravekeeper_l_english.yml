 mem_gravekeeper.200:0 "The Graveyard"
 mem_gravekeeper.200.desc:0 "Upon entering the [From.GetName] system, our ships are greeted by the sight of several large derelict spaceships. They are surrounded by an ominous "space grave" of thousands of life forms. In the middle of the debris field is what appears to be a space station that looks realtively intact."
 mem_gravekeeper.200.a:0 "What happened here?"
 
 mem_gravekeeper.201:0 "The Gravekeeper"
 mem_gravekeeper.201.desc:0 "The crew of the [Root.GetName] managed to gain access to what appears to be the central mainframe of the orbital installation. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] believes they might be able to breach the stations security protocols, reactivating the facility."
 mem_gravekeeper.201.a:0 "What could possibly go wrong?"
 mem_gravekeeper.201.a.tooltip:0 "Reactivate the space station orbiting [mem_grave_star.GetName]."
 mem_gravekeeper.201.b:0 "Let us take a step back."
 
 mem_gravekeeper.203:0 "Awakening"
 mem_gravekeeper.203.desc:0 "After taking a fierce pounding, the alien station in the [mem_grave_system.GetName] system finally loses power and appears neutralised. The victory is shortlived, power is restored moments later and the space station quickly starts reconfiguring itself before resuming combat. Clearly there is more here than meets the eye."
 mem_gravekeeper.203.a:0 "This isn't over by a long shot."
 
 mem_gravekeeper.205:0 "Graverobber"
 mem_gravekeeper.205.desc:0 "We have managed to disable the weapon in the [mem_grave_system.GetName] system. Despite the damage it took from our fleet it appears to still posses the ability to repair. Although it would take an incredible amount of resources, some of our engineers believe that if we act with haste its systems can be modified for use with our own fleets. It would certainly make for a powerful tactical asset."
 mem_gravekeeper.205.a:0 "It will make a powerful addition to the fleet."
 mem_gravekeeper.205.b:0 "This "thing" is far too dangerous. Take it apart before it can repair!"
 
 mem_gravekeeper.206:0 "From the Grave"
 mem_gravekeeper.206.desc:0 "This is a glorious day! Our engineers have finished their work on the weapon we fought in the [mem_grave_system.GetName] system and deem it safe. As safe as any ancient weapon can be that is. The AI core has been replaced, utilising a new system of our own design and we are awaiting instruction."
 mem_gravekeeper.206.a:0 "I wonder will we ever know what really happened?"
 
 mem_gravekeeper.208:0 "From the Ashes" 
 mem_gravekeeper.208.desc:0 "Our weaponry appears to be inneffective on the target. Having sustained heavy losses we should turn to a more tactical approach and attempt to devise a way to surpass the enemies defenses." 
 mem_gravekeeper.208.a:0 "We aren't so easily beaten." 
 mem_gravekeeper.208.b:0 "We have no need for this."
 
 mem_gravekeeper.209:0 "Last Rites" 
 mem_gravekeeper.209.desc:0 "Our scientists believe they have devised a way to counteract the defenses that proved impenetrable for our forces on our last encounter. We should assemble our forces and engage the enemy immediately." 
 mem_gravekeeper.209.a:0 "Victory shall be ours!" 
 
 mem_gravekeeper.210:0 "Murphy's Fallacy" 
 mem_gravekeeper.210.desc:0 "The activation was a success! The facility is fully powered and operational. All that is left to do, is to disable the remaining few security protocols, we should then have full control over the station. Our worries were for naught." 
 mem_gravekeeper.210.a:0 "This shouldn't take more than a few days."
 
 mem_gravekeeper.211:0 "Murphy's Law" 
 mem_gravekeeper.211.desc:0 "We have lost contact with our scientists in the graveyard system." 
 mem_gravekeeper.211.a:0 "What went wrong this time?" 
 
 mem_gravekeeper.212:0 "Dead Rising" 
 mem_gravekeeper.212.desc:0 "Our scientists believe we might be able to unlock the full capabilities of the ancient warship designated as the 'Gravekeeper'. For a price." 
 mem_gravekeeper.212.a:0 "We shall harness its true power, no matter the cost."
 mem_gravekeeper.212.b:0 "It's a waste of resources."
 
 mem_gravekeeper.213:0 "Necropolis"
 mem_gravekeeper.213.desc:0 "Our scientists believe that the ship is now fully operational and ready for deployment, we should be able to use its full capabilities under combat conditions."
 mem_gravekeeper.213.a:0 "Let's see how it holds up."

 mem_GRAVE_PC_PROJECT:0 "The Ancient Weapon"
 mem_GRAVE_PC_PROJECT_DESC:0 "The massive weapon that we fought in the [mem_grave_system.GetName] system is still largely intact and in the process of repairing itself. We should be able to reverse engineer its systems and put it into service with our own fleets."
