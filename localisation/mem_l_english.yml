 mem_black_hole_1_desc:0 "The black hole [Root.GetName] appears to have a small object orbiting just outside the event horizon. Upon closer examination, it appears to be a small, ancient wormhole generator built by an unknown civilization, possibly as a way of opening a path into the event horizon and investigating what lies beyond. Our scientists would like to examine the technology closer."

[Root.GetLeaderName] recognizes it as one of our prototype FTL-capable ships thought to be lost on a testflight years ago. Its orbit is unstable and the ship is slowly descending into the atmosphere. It seems to be undamaged but energy readings are minimal. We received no response to our hailing. In order to be able to further investigate what has happened to the ship and its crew its orbit has to be stabilized first. [Root.GetLeaderName] already came up with a plan."

It is hard to assess how much time had passed before the recordings start again. The flight seems to be over and the atmosphere has changed completely. Those same faces smiling a moment ago are now distorted by pain and screams echo as they mutilate themselves. The recording ends abruptly. Shall we investigate further or leave the dead to rest?"

They quickly remove the datacore to take it with them to the [Root.GetName]. Right after returning to their ship our science team monitors an energy spike inside the prototypes FTL core. They initiate emergency undocking procedures, which they barely manage to complete before the ship vanishes into the void. [Root.GetLeaderName] speculates on the possibility that the ship itself might have been changed by strange dimensional energies. Might it be alive? We may never know, but the retrieved datacore provides significant data on FTL travel."

One of the scientist´s assistants had gone mad trying to destroy the [Root.GetName] while shouting out shredded sentences about how the prototype demanded more passengers to the "Other Side". With luck and some injuries the rest of the team manages to confine him aboard the scienceship. After this event [Root.GetLeaderName] chose to destroy the prototype and everything it might have brought with it from this "Other Side" using the ship's self destruct device.

Instead, those in quarantine feel compulsions to start building something. They don't know what they wish to build, or if they do, they refuse to explain. People with no construction experience have begun to weld a metal framework, teachers are digging for a foundation, and indigents are writing code in an unknown octodecimal language.

Those affected by the virus are constructing some kind of incredibly complex biological computer.\n\nOne of the infected approached our staff, claiming to speak for the rest. They claimed that the compulsions had taken the form of voices, and that these voices were telling them that they needed to submit their bodies to some kind of invasive procedure. They requested that we not interfere.\n\nWe have no idea what will happen to our people. This could be our last chance to stop this."

 mem_ll_misc_event.22.desc:0 "Construction has completed, and our doctors report that there is no trace of the virus left in our people. The machine they built while under its influence is a computer based not on digital data, but on the movement of amino acid and protein groups. It's fascinating, if thoroughly alien.\n\nOur best guess is that the virus built itself a habitat, a persistent simulated environment based on a compatible biological structure. Communication has been made possible through temporary surrogates, and in exchange for power and regular injections of organic material, the machine has offered us its use as a computational engine. Its utility in our research efforts could be monumental."

It activated shortly after completion, putting out a gargantuan amount of data into space. At some point, the virus was completely expunged from the bodies of the infected with an automated inoculation system. Those cured of the disease have returned to their original personalities, and claim almost no memory to what has transpired.\n\nThe current theory is that this device converted the virus' constituent components into coded electronic information, then transmitted this to some unknown location. We're left with more questions than answers, along with a very large, very useless radio transmitter to remove."

The building concealed a massive viral dispersal system, a device whose sole purpose was to pour clouds of infectious agents into the atmosphere. An attempt at intervention was met with terrible violence by the infected, and new cases of the virus were reported across the planet. Security forces waged a desperate fight to stop the infected and quarantine those exposed. Cities convulsed with violence, and fires ravaged the world's industrial heartland. They managed to incarcerate or kill most of the insurgents, but some managed to escape into the wilderness. [This.GetName] mourns those lost in this brief but vicious civil war. It must rebuild, but it will never forget."

 mem_sciencecon.5.desc:0 "The Convention for Interdisciplinary Sciences did not, unfortunately, go as well as we would have hoped. Though the security team was under strict orders not to allow any substances inside the building, someone nevertheless managed to sneak some in, leading to the inebriation and public embarrassment of several scientists. What's more, it seems that our researchers have developed somewhat of a rivalry with each other based on their respective fields and many of our physicists caused a scene when they provoked our engineering department."
 #Message for the invited to see
 mem_sciencecon.5.a.desc:0 "The Convention for Interdisciplinary Sciences was somewhat of a failure. Despite our host's best efforts, some of their unruliest scientists managed to sneak a few addictive substances through security and heightened hostilities lead to a few violent confrontations between their rival researchers. Our own scientists could barely get a word in edgewise, and many generally regard the event as a ‘total waste of time'. Perhaps it'd be best not to attend next time."
 mem_sciencecon.5.a:0 "Absolutely reprehensible."

 mem_sciencecon.6.name:0 "A total catastrophe!"
 mem_sciencecon.6.desc:0 "The Convention for Interdisciplinary Sciences was an absolute failure. Despite having strict orders not to allow any substances inside the building, our security team allowed various drugs to be transported into the convention, causing widespread chaos and several hospitilizations. What's more, a respect scientist among our staff attempted to impress a potential mate by prematurely activating an experimental weapon of his own design. The weapon promptly exploded, causing widespread panic, injuring several researchers and killing said scientist. The Convention was evacuated early and many of our science officers had to be taken into custody."

It may take some time to erase this black mark off of our reputation."

 mem_sciencecon.6.b.desc:0 "The Convention for Interdisciplinary Sciences we attended was abhorrent at best and a direct insult to our people at worst. Our host's scientists were irresponsible and juvenile, casually wielding dangerous technologies and putting others at risk for the satisfaction of their petty rivalries. One individual in particular's attempt to impress a potential mate resulted in several injuries and the loss of their own life, putting a premature and swift end to the event. Whether this was some kind of joke in poor taste or an intended affront to our people, several of our scientists don't believe it worth the effort to maintain diplomatic relations with the [invite_sender.GetName]"

 mem_anomaly_failure.10.desc:0 "The apparent network of structures was little more than a deformity in the shape of the asteroid’s surface, apparently the result of an impact in the last few million years. Asteroid collisions in a system this old are rare, but not particularly noteworthy."

 mem_anomaly_event.10.name:0 "Asteroid Weapon"
 mem_anomaly_event.10.desc:0 "The artificial structures are only found on one side of the asteroid. Our best guess is that they are a network of carefully concealed engines. Though capable of limited thrust, they seem to be perfect for directing an object this large at a destination over an extended period of time, without the detectable emissions of a traditional method of interstellar propulsion. Radar and gravimetric telemetry have also revealed that the core of the asteroid is much denser than it should be, if it was a natural formation.\n\nOur working theory is that this was a weapon targeted at a planet, moon, or large station disguised to look like a wayward asteroid at first. Only once it had impacted would its nature as a targeted kinetic kill vehicle be revealed. With its original core replaced by heavier elements like tungsten, it would have enough mass to potentially render an entire world uninhabitable. Its existence, and the fact that its fuel pods are empty, imply that it missed its target. Study of the engine of this planet-killer weapon has yielded some intriguing details."

Spinning the disk elicits a deluge of sounds. [Root.GetLeaderName] believes it to be an alien form of music!\n\nUnfortunately, this music isn't very good, or at least is geared towards audio sensory equipment vastly dissimilar to our own.

It appears to be an emergency craft, judging by the lack of substantive propulsion systems, on board of which several pods capable of sustained cryogenic suspension were found. Most had been dismantled into servicing a single, jury-rigged pod, containing one occupant; although the system strained to keep them alive, by our best estimations the cryogenic system failed over five hundred years ago. Little can be determined from the creature’s dessicated remains, with stellar radiation having sterilized most of its tissues.\n\nAll's not lost, however, as the pure inventive genius of the improvised system has aided our knowledge of long-term system maintainability and cryogenics."
