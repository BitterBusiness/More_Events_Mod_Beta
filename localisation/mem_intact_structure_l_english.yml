mem_intact_structure_category_desc:0 "A small structure is still standing among the irradiated ruins, seemingly impervious to the nuclear blasts or ravages of time. We should send a survey team to determine what its purpose is."

mem_intact_structure.art.name:0 "A Monument to Their Culture"
mem_intact_structure.art.desc:0 "The science team sent to investigate the surviving building had discovered spacious halls with walls covered in colourful paintings. It appears we have ran into an art gallery of an extinguished civilization. [Root.GetLeaderName] is quite impressed with the display, citing \"16. A naked specimen reaching for a group floating above him\", \"45. Two specimen standing in front of a structure holding agricultural equipment\", \"67. A distorted image of a specimen reaching for its open mouth\" and \"112. A poorly-dressed group following a half-naked flag-bearer over a pile of corpses\" as his most favourite. The collection provided a lot of information of native's culture and appearance."


mem_intact_structure.mil.name:0 "A Monument to Their Sins"
mem_intact_structure.mil.desc:0 "Upon examination, the building turned out to be a military factory with multiple unfinished armoured vehicles still on the production line. Although design of the equipment is centuries behind our standards, some of the solutions in reinforcing the walls to withstand a nuclear blast are quite ingenious and can be useful for us even today."

mem_intact_structure.nuke.name:0 "Eternal Irony"
mem_intact_structure.nuke.desc:0 "Perhaps ironically, our science team had found much more radiation inside than outside. It appears this facility was used to store spent fuel rods for a nearby nuclear power plant. Long-term interactions between the reinforced walls, outside nuclear contaminations and nuclear waste had produced some unusual effects that might give us some insight into advanced particle interactions"

mem_intact_structure.res.name:0 "Residential Building"
mem_intact_structure.res.desc:0 "The science team had found large number of bodies inside. Although the carcass of the building survived, shockwave had breached the windows and killed most residents instantly. Survivors likely succumbed to radiation poisoning or harsh condition soon after. Lots of their personal belongings still litter the rooms."

mem_intact_structure.failure.name:0 "Building Collapsed"
mem_intact_structure.failure.desc:0 "The building has collapsed, finally succumbing to harsh conditions shortly before science team had a chance to examine it closer. It's now no more interesting than surrounding debris."
mem_intact_structure.failure.response:0 "A shame that we could not examine it on time"

mem_intact_structure.critical_failure.name:0 "Building Collapsed"
mem_intact_structure.critical_failure.desc:0 "The building survived for untold millenia and Pvt. Jenkins caused the whole structure to collapse after he drunkenly stumbled through a wall. Pvt. Jenkins somehow survived and will be reprimanded"
mem_intact_structure.critical_failure.response.1:0 "Who recruits these morons?"

mem_intact_structure.success.default:0 "Let us learn from their mistakes."
mem_intact_structure.success.default.xenophobe:0 "Good, less xenos to pollute our empire"

mem_intact_structure.success.art.default:0 "Image the art for our archives"
mem_intact_structure.success.art.xenophile:0 "Such a beautiful culture extingushed in a moment"

mem_intact_structure.success.mil.default:0 "They don't build them like they used to"
mem_intact_structure.success.mil.materialist_not_xenophobe:0 "A shame their talents are lost to the galaxy"

mem_intact_structure.success.nuke.default:0 "War, war never changes..."

mem_intact_structure.success.res.default:0 "Study the objects to see how these creatures lived"
mem_intact_structure.success.res.not_xenophile:0 "Decontaminate the objects and sell them to collectors"
mem_intact_structure.success.res.not_xenophobe:0 "Build a museum on [Root.Capital.GetName] in memory of the fallen civilization"
