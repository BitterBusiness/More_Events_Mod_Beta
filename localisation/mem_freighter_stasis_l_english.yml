 mem_throne_watchers.20.desc:0 "Local space defense personnel on [From.GetName] are reporting a possible first contact in their system. Planetary sensors detected a large object entering the outskirts of the system; upon further investigation, it appears to be a massive ship. Despite its behemoth size, it appears to be primitively constructed and bears no signs of any sort of FTL drive or of ever having travelled faster than light. Local officials have repeatedly hailed it, but have received no response.\n\nThe ship is flying directly toward the local star [From.System.GetName]. It has not been observed to change course, which may indicate its navigational systems are disabled.\n\nThe ship is too large to get accurate readings on the interior. We would need to send a boarding party to be certain what it has onboard."
