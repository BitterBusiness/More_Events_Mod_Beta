mem_ancient_graveyard_category:0 "A weird signal"
mem_ancient_graveyard_category_desc:0 "Sensors are picking strange reading from a large valley on planet's surface, as if it is filled in regular grid pattern with small metallic spikes. Too small to properly discern from orbit, they might require a closer look."

mem_ancient_graveyard.1.name:0 "A final resting place for many"
mem_ancient_graveyard.1.desc:0 "Surveyors discovered almost a billion upward-faced primitive pulse rifles, each muzzle topped by what appears to be a visored helmet of some alien species dotting the valley, as if marking resting place of countless soldiers fallen in an ancient battle. Although well-preserved in almost vacuum, primitive rifle design is of little interest to our scientists. Deep scanning into ground underneath also revealed nothing of value. Whatever happened here aeons ago, we might never know."

mem_ancient_graveyard.2.name:0 "A false positive sensor reading"
mem_ancient_graveyard.2.desc:0 "It appears that strange pattern was nothing but an echo caused by an improper sensor calibration. Second sweep revealed nothing of interest."

mem_ancient_graveyard.1.default:0 "Let them rest in peace."
mem_ancient_graveyard.1.xenophobe:0 "More dead xenos, huh?"

mem_ancient_graveyard.2.dissapointing:0 "Dissapointing."
