 mem_sleepers.2.desc:0 "Our observation post over [Planet] is reporting unusual and alarming readings coming from the planet. They are picking up an energy signature originating from beneath the planet's surface in an isolated region. The strength of the signal beyond anything native technology could produce and is notably similar to our own power plants. More alarmingly, the signature clearly indicates a growing instability in the power source. This will likely end in disaster if we don't act fast."
 mem_sleepers.2.a:0 "Send in specialists to investigate this."

 mem_sleepers.3.desc:0 "A massive underground explosion ripped through the crust of [Planet], sending ash and rocks into the atmosphere with power rivaling a supervolcano eruption. Whatever there was to be found at ground zero is now certainly vaporised. Our observation post reports that natives who witnessed the incident are overawed by the catastrophe, and local cultures are experiencing a surge of spirituality born out of fear before the gods' wrath."
 mem_sleepers.3.a:0 "Seems like it could have been worse."

 mem_sleepers.3.name:0 "Ground Zero"
 mem_sleepers.3.desc:0 "A massive underground explosion ripped through the crust of [Planet], sending ash and rocks into the atmosphere with power surpassing that of a supervolcano eruption. This triggered supersonic pressure waves throughout the planet's atmosphere, a cascading series of massive earthquakes, and smothering plumes of dust and cinders sufficient to send the entire planet into a permanent twilight. This catastrophe has devastated the biosphere and extinguished the native civilization. Whatever we could have found at the ground zero was certainly vaporised.\n\nOur observation post has been shut down as there is nothing left we could observe here."
 mem_sleepers.3.a:0 "I wish we could have prevented this."
 mem_sleepers.3.b:0 "What a waste of a nice planet..."
