 #Project
 MEM_SLEEPERS_SCAN:0 "Alarming Energy Readings"
 MEM_SLEEPERS_SCAN_DESC:0 "Our observation post over §Y[From.GetName]§! is reporting unusual and alarming readings coming from the planet."
 
 mem_sleepers.2.name:0 "Down Below"
 mem_sleepers.2.desc:0 "Our observation post over §Y[From.GetName]§! is reporting unusual and alarming readings coming from the planet. They are picking up an energy signature originating from beneath the planet's surface in an isolated region. The strength of the signal is beyond anything native technology could produce and is notably similar to our own power plants. More alarmingly, the signature clearly indicates a growing instability in the power source. This will likely end in disaster if we don't act fast."
 mem_sleepers.2.a:0 "Send in specialists to investigate this."
 
 #Failed to do the project (Soft Fail)
 mem_sleepers.3.name:0 "Ground Zero"
 mem_sleepers.3.desc:0 "A massive underground explosion ripped through the crust of §Y[From.From.From.GetName]§!, sending ash and rocks into the atmosphere with power rivaling a supervolcano eruption. Whatever there was to be found at ground zero is now certainly vaporised.\n\nOur observation post reports that natives who witnessed the incident are overawed by the catastrophe, and local cultures are experiencing a surge of spirituality born out of fear before the gods' wrath."
 mem_sleepers.3.a:0 "Seems like it could have been worse."
 
 #Failed to do the project (Hard Fail)
 mem_sleepers.4.name:0 "Ground Zero"
 mem_sleepers.4.desc:0 "A massive underground explosion ripped through the crust of §Y[From.From.From.GetName]§!, sending ash and rocks into the atmosphere with power surpassing that of a supervolcano eruption. This triggered supersonic pressure waves throughout the planet's atmosphere, a cascading series of massive earthquakes, and smothering plumes of dust and cinders sufficient to send the entire planet into a permanent twilight. This catastrophe has devastated the biosphere and extinguished the native civilization. Whatever we could have found at the ground zero was certainly vaporised.\n\nOur observation post has been shut down as there is nothing left we could observe here."
 mem_sleepers.4.a:0 "I wish we could have prevented this."
 mem_sleepers.4.b:0 "What a waste of a nice planet..."
 
 #Finished Project
 mem_sleepers.5.name:0 "Underground Vault"
 mem_sleepers.5.desc:0 "Following the energy signature on §Y[From.From.From.GetName]§! required precise drilling from our science team but ultimately led them to a vast cavern system. Once inside the team uncovered a large artificial structure deliberately concealed within. The structure was unambiguously built using space-age technology, centuries ahead of what the natives of this planet should be capable of. Within this structure the crew was startled to find countless sleeping pods lining the walls, containing aliens which are not only unlike the §Y[mem_sleepers_natives.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§!, but also unlike any other species known to us, as well as massive stockpile of advanced military hardware. Yet language used on terminals and labels bears a remarkable resemblance to languages we learned from observing the natives.\n\nOur engineers in reactor control have assessed the situation, which is rather anticlimatic after the earlier discoveries. Centuries, if not millennia, without maintenance have taken their toll, but with our level of technology stabilizing the reactor should be trivial, especially if we are willing to sacrifice some of our own resources."
 mem_sleepers.5.a:0 "Try to stabilize it and then reactivate the vault."
 mem_sleepers.5.a.tooltip:0 "An amount of 500 energy credits will be used for this project."
 mem_sleepers.5.b.tooltip:0 "As we lack the needed 500 energy credits we´ll have to borrow the amount from our private sector."
 mem_sleepers.5.c:0 "Just depower all systems and scrap the vault for valuables."
 mem_sleepers.5.c.tooltip:0 "Our team will start dismantling everything not necessary for the vault´s structural integrity."
 mem_sleepers.5.d:0 "Xeno lifes aren't worth risking our team. Let it blow up."
 
 #Letting it blow up as a xenophobe
 mem_sleepers.8.name:0 "Ground Zero"
 mem_sleepers.8.desc:0 "A massive underground explosion ripped through the crust of §Y[From.From.From.From.GetName]§!, sending ash and rocks into the atmosphere with power rivaling a supervolcano eruption. There is nothing left of the vault complex.\n\nOur observation post reports that natives who witnessed the incident are overawed by the catastrophe, and local cultures are experiencing a surge of spirituality born out of fear before the gods' wrath."
 mem_sleepers.8.a:0 "Well...whatever."

 mem_sleepers.9.desc:0 "A massive underground explosion ripped through the crust of §Y[From.From.From.From.GetName]§!, sending ash and rocks into the atmosphere with power surpassing that of a supervolcano eruption. This triggered supersonic pressure waves throughout the planet's atmosphere, a cascading series of massive earthquakes, and smothering plumes of dust and cinders sufficient to send the entire planet into a permanent twilight. This catastrophe has devastated the biosphere and extinguished the native civilization. Our scientists were suprised by the explosion´s scale. It was far beyond all prior expectations.\n\nOur observation post has been shut down as there is nothing left we could observe here."
