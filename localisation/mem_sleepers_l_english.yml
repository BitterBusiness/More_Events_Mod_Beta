 #Project
 MEM_SLEEPERS_SCAN:0 "Alarming Energy Readings"
 MEM_SLEEPERS_SCAN_DESC:0 "Our observation post over §Y[From.GetName]§! is reporting unusual and alarming readings coming from the planet."
 
 mem_sleepers.2.name:0 "Down Below"
 mem_sleepers.2.desc:0 "Our observation post over §Y[From.GetName]§! is reporting unusual and alarming readings coming from the planet. They are picking up an energy signature originating from beneath the planet's surface in an isolated region. The strength of the signal is beyond anything native technology could produce and is notably similar to our own power plants. More alarmingly, the signature clearly indicates a growing instability in the power source. This will likely end in disaster if we don't act fast."
 mem_sleepers.2.a:0 "Send in specialists to investigate this."
 
 #Failed to do the project (Soft Fail)
 mem_sleepers.3.name:0 "Ground Zero"
 mem_sleepers.3.desc:0 "A massive underground explosion ripped through the crust of §Y[From.From.From.GetName]§!, sending ash and rocks into the atmosphere with power rivaling a supervolcano eruption. Whatever there was to be found at ground zero is now certainly vaporised.\n\nOur observation post reports that natives who witnessed the incident are overawed by the catastrophe, and local cultures are experiencing a surge of spirituality born out of fear before the gods' wrath."
 mem_sleepers.3.a:0 "Seems like it could have been worse."
 
 #Failed to do the project (Hard Fail)
 mem_sleepers.4.name:0 "Ground Zero"
 mem_sleepers.4.desc:0 "A massive underground explosion ripped through the crust of §Y[From.From.From.GetName]§!, sending ash and rocks into the atmosphere with power surpassing that of a supervolcano eruption. This triggered supersonic pressure waves throughout the planet's atmosphere, a cascading series of massive earthquakes, and smothering plumes of dust and cinders sufficient to send the entire planet into a permanent twilight. This catastrophe has devastated the biosphere and extinguished the native civilization. Whatever we could have found at the ground zero was certainly vaporised.\n\nOur observation post has been shut down as there is nothing left we could observe here."
 mem_sleepers.4.a:0 "I wish we could have prevented this."
 mem_sleepers.4.b:0 "What a waste of a decent planet..."
 
 #Finished Project
 mem_sleepers.5.name:0 "Underground Vault"
 mem_sleepers.5.desc:0 "Following the energy signature on §Y[From.From.From.GetName]§! required precise drilling from our science team but ultimately led them to a vast cavern system. Once inside the team uncovered a large artificial structure deliberately concealed within. The structure was unambiguously built using space-age technology, centuries ahead of what the natives of this planet should be capable of. Within this structure the crew was startled to find countless sleeping pods lining the walls, containing aliens which are not only unlike the §Y[mem_sleepers_natives.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§!, but also unlike any other species known to us, as well as massive stockpile of advanced military hardware. Yet the language used on terminals and labels bears a remarkable resemblance to languages we learned from observing the natives.\n\nOur engineers in reactor control have assessed the situation, which is rather anticlimatic after the earlier discoveries. Centuries, if not millennia, without maintenance have taken their toll, but with our level of technology stabilizing the reactor should be trivial, especially if we are willing to sacrifice some of our own resources."
 mem_sleepers.5.a:0 "Try to stabilize it and then reactivate the vault."
 mem_sleepers.5.a.tooltip:0 "An amount of 500 energy credits will be used for this project."
 mem_sleepers.5.b.tooltip:0 "As we lack the needed 500 energy credits we'll have to borrow the amount from our private sector."
 mem_sleepers.5.c:0 "Just depower all systems and scrap the vault for valuables."
 mem_sleepers.5.c.tooltip:0 "Our team will start dismantling everything not necessary for the vault's structural integrity."
 mem_sleepers.5.d:0 "Xeno lifes aren't worth risking our team. Let it blow up."
 
 #Looting the Vault and potentially getting uplifting tech option
 mem_sleepers.6.name:0 "Technological Treasure"
 mem_sleepers.6.desc:0 "After powering down the sleeper pods and putting their occupants to their final rest our team began to work through all the potentially useful materials as well as historical and technological data stored in the vault's central server.\n\nThe builders of this place might not have been a spacefaring civilisation yet they were very advanced in biotech. Ironically that very advancement led to their own demise when a slave species they had uplifted (all details indicate them to be the ancestors of today's §Y[mem_sleepers_natives.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§!) to do their biddings, revolted and nearly eradicated their whole race with only a few finding shelter in this underground facility.\n\nIt might not have worked out for them, but our scientists see great potential in the found fragments of uplifting technology."
 mem_sleepers.6.a:0 "Another technological breakthrough. Good work!"
 
 #Some sleepers awake and attack your looting team (small explosion) Scientist dies
 mem_sleepers.7.name:0 "From the Grave"
 mem_sleepers.7.desc:0 "As our science team was buisy dismantling the facility a hidden failsafe mechanism must have awakened some of the sleepers. They were all but happy about our team's work and a firefight broke out. Our superiour firepower turned the tide of battle fast...But not fast enough.\n\nRealizing their impending doom the last remains of the sleepers initiated the vault's self-destruct mechanism taking our team - including our chief scientist - with them.\n\nA massive underground explosion ripped through the crust of §Y[From.From.From.From.GetName]§!, sending ash and rocks into the atmosphere with power rivaling a supervolcano eruption. There is nothing left of the vault complex.\n\nOur observation post reports that natives who witnessed the incident are overawed by the catastrophe, and local cultures are experiencing a surge of spirituality born out of fear before the gods' wrath."

 #Sleepers Awake
 mem_sleepers.50.name:0 "Sleepers Awake"
 mem_sleepers.50.desc:0 "With the influx of energy, lights turn on through the silent corridors of the vault. One after another sleeper pods open. our team hurries to the council chambers, where leaders of the sleeper society were stored. There one of the awakened greets them.\n\nThe language despite having its own distinctions is clearly recognized to be related to the language spoken by the local primitives. After a few sentences our universal translators begins to partially translate and communications are established.\n\nThey call themselves §YOzari§!. Millennia ago their species has evolved here and dominated the planet. Long before they were ready to reach for the stars, they advanced their biotechnology and genetics to remarkable levels. Their experiments led them to uplift another species from their planet into sentience to be servants, soldiers and to one day perhaps join them as equals. These uplifted beings were ancestors of a species we know today as §Y[mem_sleepers_natives.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§!. However differences between their two species led to conflict and although scientific knowledge was widely withheld from the uplifted, they found strengh in numbers. In the following war they drove their masters to the brink of extinction, and forced them to seek refuge in the vast underground vault we have found them in."
 mem_sleepers.50.a:0 "What will they do now?"
 mem_sleepers.50.a.response:0 ""Now there's one thing left to do before we can move on..." - he concluded.\n\nOur team is informed that the §YOzari§! prepare themselves to meet the decendents of their former slaves."

Their memory lived on, as myths and legends of gods, betrayed by their ungrateful ancestors.\n\nOnce the §YOzari§! revealed themselves, the §Y[mem_sleepers_natives.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! rejoiced, seeing their benefactors return from their grave. The bond was forged anew, and leaders of the both species promised to never repeat the mistakes of the past. Now they are hailing us wishing to discuss their relationship with our empire."

What technology they had, was lost in time and without the guiding hand of their former masters they were forced to build their own civilization from scratch.\n\nWith their nearly non existent technology they were no match for the §YOzari's§! weapons stockpiled inside the vault. Gliders and drone strikes killed most of the primitives within days, leaving the reawakened §YOzari§! as sole masters of §Y[From.From.From.From.From.GetName]§!.
