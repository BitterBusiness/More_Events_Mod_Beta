EVENT OVERVIEW:

The event has a chance of firing if you have a colony world with a mountain range tile_blocker which has not had any other colony events (so this cannot happen on the same planet as, e.g., Subterranean Civilization). When the event fires, one of your mountain range tile_blockers is replaced with a strange_mountain tile_blocker, and a special project (requiring a science ship) is created to scan the planet for ancient ruins. The strange_mountain cannot be removed.

Completing the first special project gives you an invitation to a second special_project to excavate the mountain, at a cost of 200 energy and minerals. You can either accept, say you want to be asked again later, or say you don't want to do it at all. If you accept, either on the first time or later, a second special project (not requiring a science ship) is created to do the excavation. Completing the second special project triggers the rest of the event sequence. If you say you never want to do this and stop asking, a long time period passes, and then you get an event saying a group of private investors went ahead with the project without your help, triggering the rest of the event sequence.

Either way, whether you do it yourself or a private group does, two things happen. First, you gain access to a special project to reverse-engineer the robots which, on completion, gives you some progress on the Synths tech choice. Second, one of two things then happens: either the AI is friendly, or it is unfriendly. If it is friendly, the strange_mountain is replaced with an AI factory building which provides significant bonuses to the planet. After a period of time, however, the AI eventually destabilizes and goes rogue. In addition, if you dismantle or replace the AI factory, the AI goes rogue immediately.

Once the AI becomes unfriendly - either immediately or after a period of time - the AI factory building is replaced by an AI factory tile_blocker (since you can't use it at this point), and a group of eight super robot armies swarm out to attack. If your defenders are defeated, they begin purging the population of the planet one at a time at a relatively slow rate.

Once the first swarm of robots is defeated, a special project is created to lay siege to the final AI citadel. This requires a minimum of eight assault armies to complete. Once it is completed, a second, larger swarm of super robot armies emerges.

If the second swarm defeats you, the AI wrecks the planet: the entire population is killed and the planet is changed to a tomb world.

If you defeat the second swarm, you bring the AI back under control. The AI factory tile_blocker is turned into an AI factory building again, and you gain the ability to manufacture super robot armies. You can only make four of them, however.

USEFUL DEBUG EVENTS:

Firing the event "asnys.16" from the console will immediately place a "Strange Mountain" tile blocker on your capital planet and begin the event sequence.

KNOWN ISSUES:

1: Change trigger to accord with other colony events.
11: What if the planet is invaded by someone else during the sequence?
41: Art not yet uploaded for hostile AI factory - it will look like a random tile blocker.
